## Recommendation system

Codes in **glossory** are used for data-preprocessing (both review data and business data) and restaurants clustering.  
  
**src** contains python scripts that create features. In xgboost_kruskal.py, kruskal test is conducted on the features selected by XGBoost. In Features.ipynb, based on those features, we search adjectives describing those features through the texts.
